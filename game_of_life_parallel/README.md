************* GAME OF LIFE BUT PARALLEL *************

Author: Duc Dam

About: Pushing https://github.com/ducdamchi/C_programming/tree/main/game_of_life further, I am making a version that uses pthreads() to allow for concurrent processing in the CPU, which can improve running time.

Work in Progress!
